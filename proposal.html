			<h2>Organisation</h2>
			<p>The Society of The Protection of Animals Abroad (also known as SPANA) is an international non-profit organization that helps sick and injured working animals including donkeys, horses, camels and elephants. SPANA’s mission is <strong>to improve the lives of working animals in often desperately poor communities in Africa, Central America, and Asia</strong>. </p>
      <p>Currently they are focusing on providing veterinary care, training and educating children to develop positive beliefs, respect and compassion towards animals. In Australia, most of SPANA’s income <strong>comes from donations and bequests </strong> which are used to set up a clinical skills centre in a university in Lombok, Indonesia to teach practical equine skills to new vets.  </p>

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>To find out<i> the current needs, issues around the general topic</i> (charitable giving for animal welfare) as well as <i>determine the target audience</i>, <strong>a secondary research</strong> was conducted. Additionally, <strong> primary research </strong> was conducted through questionnaires and interviews to find out the demographics, behaviours, and line of thought of the people that are interested in contributing to SPANA. The secondary research was done first so that <i>the needs and issues have been identified </i>before conducting the primary research.</p>

      <h4 id="secondary">Secondary Research</h4>
        <p>Recently in Australia there has been <strong>a decline in the number of people who donate to charities</strong>. In an article by Roy Morgan, It was found that in 2018 only 60% of Australians donate to charity over a 12 month period compared to 66% in 2014 ("Slowdown in giving to charity a major issue", 2019). Given <strong>the recent pandemic in 2020</strong>, it is not surprising that <strong>this issue has become worse</strong> even though charities and social services are being relied upon the most around this time ("Philanthropy and COVID-19 ›› Philanthropy Australia", 2020).</p>

        <p>COVID-19 is having <strong>further impacts on veterinarians</strong> who have a big impact on improving the lives of not just pets but working animals as well ("Puppies & burnout: The economic impact of the coronavirus on vets", 2020). <strong>With less donations and bequests, veterinarians are unable to cope and help working animals during the pandemic</strong>. Thus, it is important to raise awareness on this issue so that more people can contribute to SPANA.</p>

      <h4 id="target">Target Audience</h4>
        <p>The first target audience are adults (aged 25-34 years old) who are interested in donating to animal welfare charities. According to a report on charitable giving by Good2Give, it was found that in Australia those aged 25-34 are more likely to make a donation (74% of respondents) compared to the younger age group (18-24 years old) who are more likely to volunteer (An overview of charitable giving in Australia. (2020). Australia Giving 2019). Additionally, for educational experience and further contributions to the organisation the younger group are targeted as well. </p>
      
      <blockquote>Thus, the overall scope of the target audience is those of the age 18-34 who are concerned and/or interested in contributing to animal welfare charities. </blockquote>

      <h4 id="primary">Primary Research</h4>
      <p>To begin the primary research, a questionnaire was given to the targeted age range (18 to 34 years old). The questionnaire was conducted <strong>to find out the demographics around the identified problem space</strong>. Key findings from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YouDhQ_g-vOHPWD6LryDjNHBJLhNa4nAomr83f1Z6QA/edit?usp=sharing">survey</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Majority of the respondents have contributed to a charity before </li>
          <li>Majority said that they have never heard of a charity that focuses on animal welfare before</li>
          <li>All of the respondents have never heard of SPANA before</li>
          <li>The most prefered method of contributing to animal welfare charities is through donation (40% of respondents) with volunteers and buying goods as second (20%of respondents).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        An interview was conducted to 10 participants <strong>to find out their underlying motivation for visiting charity websites and their opinion towards SPANA's current website</strong>. Key findings from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YouDhQ_g-vOHPWD6LryDjNHBJLhNa4nAomr83f1Z6QA/edit?usp=sharing">interview</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>A lot of the participants think that the main reason people go to SPANA’s website is to find information on working animals.</li>
          <li>Generally, people prefer if the charity or organisation would show their impacts more clearly in the website (by highlighting them for example)</li>
          <li>People care if the organisation is being transparent about where the money they donated would go to in the website</li>
          <li>Almost all of the participants mentioned WWF website a good example of an animal welfare charity website that they have visited before</li>
          <li>Majority like simple but impactful message in the website</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 id="conclusion">Research Conclusion</h4>
      <blockquote>Based on the findings from the secondary and primary research, we can conclude that there’s a need for more donations and volunteers to animal welfare charities from people in Australia. These people are mostly oblivious about the current issues on working animals. Thus, the need of an educational website experience whilst giving them options to contribute to the charity needs to be addressed.</blockquote>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Bellow are user profiles that are made based on the findings of the research:</p>

      <h3 id="concept">The Concept</h3>
			<blockquote>
      The proposed website would be an educational experience about the struggles of working animals whilst giving options for the user to contribute through donation or volunteering.

		<section id="ideation">
			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>In the ideation phase, multiple concepts were explored through the use <strong>moodboards, sitemaps, and sketches</strong>. Bellow are detailed explanation on design decisions and reflection of each process:</p>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Mooboards were made to explore different visuals for the website through styles and colours. Creating moodboards helps make the design process easier. Bellow are the moodboards that were created:</p>

			<h4 id="firstmoodboard">First Mood Board</h4>
      <p>The first moodboard emphasises on the use of vibrant colours that attracts young generations. The colours used for this moodboard are :
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Yellow</strong> - conveys a warm and inviting feel for the website as the purpose of the website is to donate.</li>
         <li><strong>Orange</strong> - known to have a powerful attention-getting properties which is essential so that the user don't feel quickly bored</li>
         <li><strong>Blue</strong> - symbolises trust, loyalty and wisdom which tells the user that the organisation is trustworthy.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/firstmoodboard.png" alt="first moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>First Moodboard, created using Canva</figcaption>
      </figure>
      </p>
      
      <h4 id="secondmoodboard">Second Mood Board</h4>
      <p>The second moodboard was inspired by cinematic filters that are often used in movies or photos. The main idea for this concept is to convey a story through the use of colour change (from black and white to green). In the moodboard the colours used are:
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Black</strong> - represents death, hardships, and negative connotations. But it also brings elegance to the website.</li>
         <li><strong>White</strong> - used incombination with black to create the cinematic look before the colour change</li>
         <li><strong>Green</strong> - represents positivity and happy emotion which in this context is used to tell the user that their impact can bring a postive change.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/secondmoodboard.png" alt="second moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>Second Moodboard, created using Canva</figcaption>
      </figure>
      </p>

      <h4 id="moodboarddecision">Decision</h4>
      <p>The chosen moodboard is <strong>the second moodboard</strong> as the colours in the first moodboard, although great to grab attention, doesn’t represent the organisation very well (SPANA’s colours are more towards nature like green, brown, etc). The second moodboard is more fitting with SPANA’s logo and aesthetic as the colours are more neutral.</p>

		  <h3 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h3>
      <p>To plan out the contents of the website, iterations of sitemaps were created. Sitemap is a great tool to use as a guide for a website as it provides information about pages and files in the site. It also makes it easier for search engine crawlers to read the content on the site and index the pages accordingly("5 Easy Steps to Creating a Sitemap For a Website", 2020).</p>
      <p>For the <strong>first iteration</strong>, the sitemap was sketched using a simple diagram showing how the overall structure of the website would look like. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/sitemapsimple_sketch.jpg" alt="first sitemap iteration"/>
        <figcaption>First Sitemap Iteration</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In the <strong>second iteration</strong>, a more <strong>detailed verison of the sitemap</strong> was created by listing down the contents of the pages. Furthermore, the <strong>"Contact Us" page was removed from the diagram</strong> as it was more suited to be placed at the bottom of each page when the user scrolls down along with links to social media accounts.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/sitemap_sketch.jpg" alt="second sitemap iteration"/>
        <figcaption>Second Sitemap Iteration</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, in the <strong>third iteration</strong> the sitemap was made into a <strong>digital format</strong> with specified headings for the contents based on the second iteration.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/digitalsitemap.png" alt="digital sitemap"/>
        <figcaption>Third/Final Sitemap Iteration, made with Miro</figcaption>
      </figure>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>After finalising the sitemap, iterations of sketches were made to visualise how the website is going to look like for each page. Sketching is a great tool to plan and explore different layouts for the website prior to wireframing as it is quick and easy to iterate.</p>
      <h4 id="landingsketch">Landing Page</h4>
      <p>The first page that the user will see is the landing page so it needs to leave a good impression. Thus, <strong>four iterations</strong> were made in the sketching process for this page. </p>
      <figure>
			<img src="images/landingpage_sketch.jpg" alt="landing page sketch"/>
        <figcaption>4 Iterations of Landing Page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>Explanation on each iteration:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First Iteration(I1)</strong> - uses a hamburger menu for navigation to achieve a clean look but the main content is laid out in a less enganging way.</li>
          <li><strong>Second Iteration(I2)</strong> - experimented with a menu bar for navigation, a slideshow and a video in the content section. The video element was thought to be unnecessary as there was already a slideshow.</li>
          <li><strong>Third Iteration(I3)</strong> - experimented with clickable images for the content (SPANA's Mission) with a simple layout using circles that is meant to make the user want to click them.</li>
          <li><strong>Fourth Iteration(I4)</strong> - finally, decided to <strong>finalise the design by combining the third iteration and  the navigation bar used in the second iteration</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 id="aboutsketch">About Us Page</h4>
      <p>For this page, there wasn't as many iterations as the landing page. The visuals were kept similar to the landing page to keep consistency. The concept for this page is using a timeline line graph to illustrate SPANA's achievements and future plans. Several different approches to the timeline were explored in the sketch (vertical and horizontal layout). </p>
      <figure>
			<img src="images/about_sketch.jpg" alt="About Us page sketch"/>
        <figcaption>About Us Page Sketch</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> <strong>The final decision was to have the vertical layout timeline graph with mobile restrictions in mind (the horizotal layout wouldn't be possible in the mobile version.</strong>
      </p>
      <h4 id="animalsketch">Animals Page</h4>
      <p>This page is an educational page on the types of working animals that are impacted. The content of this page is based on the user profile needs where the <strong>user is frustrated about not being able to quickly find out about the list of animals that are impacted</strong>. Thus, ways in which the page presents the list were explored through multiple iterations.</p>
      <figure>
			<img src="images/animalspage_sketch.jpg" alt="Animals page sketch"/>
        <figcaption>Animals Page Sketch</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>Explanation on each iteration:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Iteration(I1)</strong> - uses clickable images in a rectangle form that directs the user to a specific section in the page. A good concept but the visuals are not consistent enough (there's no background image for the title like in the landing page)</li>
        <li><strong>Second Iteration(I2)</strong> - experimented with an image as a background for the title to match with the other pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Iteration(I3)</strong> - finally, decided to <strong>change the shape of the clickable image with a circle to keep design consistency as the landing page.</strong>  </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
     <h4 id="donatepage">Donate Page</h4>
     <p>The donate page concept was made to be very simple as the user needs to quickly see the call-to-action button in the page. The content for this page is also based on the user profile where <strong>transparency of where the money goes needs to be explained</strong>. The sketches explored two different layouts for the content.</p>
      <figure>
			<img src="images/donatepage_sketch.jpg" alt="Donate page sketch"/>
        <figcaption>Donate Page Sketch</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>The final decision for this page is to simplify the process of donating by having three buttons for the different methods the user can donate with. The buttons would direct the user to a paypal/bpay/mastercard URL.</strong></p>

      <h4 id="volunteersketch">Volunteer Page</h4>
        <p>The idea for this page is a simple form for personal data that users can quickly access after reading what they will do for volunteering work. There weren't many iterations for this page and the design is kept very minimal and consistent with the previous pages.</p>
      <figure>
			  <img src="images/volunteersketch.jpg" alt="Volunteer page sketch"/>
        <figcaption>Volunteer Page Sketch</figcaption>
      </figure>
  </section>

		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Following the development and exploration of the sketches, the design was further developed into <strong>wireframes and mockups</strong>. </p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>Bellow are the wireframes that were created based on the final sketch for each page. Each of the wireframe is made with a visualisation of the scrolling feature:</p>
